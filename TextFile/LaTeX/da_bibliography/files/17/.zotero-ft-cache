Please refer to the DataGrid Class page on MSDN. From that page:

    Selection

    By default, the entire row is selected when a user clicks a cell in a DataGrid, and a user can select multiple rows. You can set the SelectionMode property to specify whether a user can select cells, full rows, or both. Set the SelectionUnit property to specify whether multiple rows or cells can be selected, or only single rows or cells.

    You can get information about the cells that are selected from the SelectedCells property. You can get information about cells for which selection has changed in the SelectedCellsChangedEventArgs of the SelectedCellsChanged event. Call the SelectAllCells or UnselectAllCells methods to programmatically select or unselect all cells. For more information, see Default Keyboard and Mouse Behavior in the DataGrid Control.

I have added links to the relevant properties for you, but I'm out of time now, so I hope you can follow the links to get your solution.

When I faced this problem, I approached it like this: I created a DataRowView , grabbed the column index, and then used that in the row's ItemArray

 DataRowView dataRow = ( DataRowView ) dataGrid1 . SelectedItem ; int index = dataGrid1 . CurrentCell . Column . DisplayIndex ; string cellValue = dataRow . Row . ItemArray [ index ]. ToString ();

If you are selecting only one cell then get selected cell content like this

 var cellInfo = dataGrid1 . SelectedCells [ 0 ]; var content = cellInfo . Column . GetCellContent ( cellInfo . Item );  

Here content will be your selected cells value

And if you are selecting multiple cells then you can do it like this

 var cellInfos = dataGrid1 . SelectedCells ; var list1 = new List <string> (); foreach ( DataGridCellInfo cellInfo in cellInfos ) { if ( cellInfo . IsValid ) { //GetCellContent returns FrameworkElement var content = cellInfo . Column . GetCellContent ( cellInfo . Item ); //Need to add the extra lines of code below to get desired output //get the datacontext from FrameworkElement and typecast to DataRowView var row = ( DataRowView ) content . DataContext ; //ItemArray returns an object array with single element object [] obj = row . Row . ItemArray ; //store the obj array in a list or Arraylist for later use list1 . Add ( obj [ 0 ]. ToString ()); } }

If SelectionUnit="Cell" try this:

 string cellValue = GetSelectedCellValue ();  

Where:

 public string GetSelectedCellValue () { DataGridCellInfo cellInfo = MyDataGrid . SelectedCells [ 0 ]; if ( cellInfo == null ) return null ; DataGridBoundColumn column = cellInfo . Column as DataGridBoundColumn ; if ( column == null ) return null ; FrameworkElement element = new FrameworkElement () { DataContext = cellInfo . Item }; BindingOperations . SetBinding ( element , TagProperty , column . Binding ); return element . Tag . ToString (); }  

Seems like it shouldn't be that complicated, I know...

Edit: This doesn't seem to work on DataGridTemplateColumn type columns. You could also try this if your rows are made up of a custom class and you've assigned a sort member path:

 public string GetSelectedCellValue () { DataGridCellInfo cells = MyDataGrid . SelectedCells [ 0 ]; YourRowClass item = cells . Item as YourRowClass ; string columnName = cells . Column . SortMemberPath ; if ( item == null || columnName == null ) return null ; object result = item . GetType (). GetProperty ( columnName ). GetValue ( item , null ); if ( result == null ) return null ; return result . ToString (); }

These are 2 methods that can be used to take a value from the selected row

 /// <summary> /// Take a value from a the selected row of a DataGrid /// ATTENTION : The column's index is absolute : if the DataGrid is reorganized by the user, /// the index must change /// </summary> /// <param name="dGrid">The DataGrid where we take the value</param> /// <param name="columnIndex">The value's line index</param> /// <returns>The value contained in the selected line or an empty string if nothing is selected</returns> public static string getDataGridValueAt ( DataGrid dGrid , int columnIndex ) { if ( dGrid . SelectedItem == null ) return "" ; string str = dGrid . SelectedItem . ToString (); // Take the selected line str = str . Replace ( "}" , "" ). Trim (). Replace ( "{" , "" ). Trim (); // Delete useless characters if ( columnIndex < 0 || columnIndex >= str . Split ( ',' ). Length ) // case where the index can't be used return "" ; str = str . Split ( ',' )[ columnIndex ]. Trim (); str = str . Split ( '=' )[ 1 ]. Trim (); return str ; } /// <summary> /// Take a value from a the selected row of a DataGrid /// </summary> /// <param name="dGrid">The DataGrid where we take the value.</param> /// <param name="columnName">The column's name of the searched value. Be careful, the parameter must be the same as the shown on the dataGrid</param> /// <returns>The value contained in the selected line or an empty string if nothing is selected or if the column doesn't exist</returns> public static string getDataGridValueAt ( DataGrid dGrid , string columnName ) { if ( dGrid . SelectedItem == null ) return "" ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < columnName . Length ; i ++) if ( columnName . ElementAt ( i ) == '_' ) { columnName = columnName . Insert ( i , "_" ); i ++; } string str = dGrid . SelectedItem . ToString (); // Get the selected Line str = str . Replace ( "}" , "" ). Trim (). Replace ( "{" , "" ). Trim (); // Remove useless characters for ( int i = 0 ; i < str . Split ( ',' ). Length ; i ++) if ( str . Split ( ',' )[ i ]. Trim (). Split ( '=' )[ 0 ]. Trim () == columnName ) // Check if the searched column exists in the dataGrid. return str . Split ( ',' )[ i ]. Trim (). Split ( '=' )[ 1 ]. Trim (); return str ; }

I struggled with this one for a long time! (Using VB.NET) Basically you get the row index and column index of the selected cell, and then use that to access the value.

 Private Sub LineListDataGrid_SelectedCellsChanged ( sender As Object , e As SelectedCellsChangedEventArgs ) Handles LineListDataGrid . SelectedCellsChanged Dim colInd As Integer = LineListDataGrid . CurrentCell . Column . DisplayIndex Dim rowInd As Integer = LineListDataGrid . Items . IndexOf ( LineListDataGrid . CurrentItem ) Dim item As String Try item = LLDB . LineList . Rows ( rowInd )( colInd ) Catch Exit Sub End Try End Sub  

End Class

 //Xaml Code < DataGrid . Columns > < DataGridTextColumn Binding = "{Binding Path=Date, Converter={StaticResource dateconverter}, Mode=OneWay}" Header = "Date" Width = "100" /> < DataGridTextColumn Binding = "{Binding Path=Prescription}" Header = "Prescription" Width = "900" /> </ DataGrid . Columns > //C# Code DataRowView row = ( DataRowView ) grid1 . SelectedItem ; MessageBox . Show ( row [ "Prescription" ]. toString () + " " + row [ "Date" ]. toString ());  

As WPF provides binding in DataGrids, this should be rather transparent. However, the following method only works, if you have used SQLDataAdapter and provided a binding path to your DataGridColoumns. For eg. Let's say the above datagrid is named grid1, which has auto generate columns set to false, and is using binding to bind column names to Headers. In this case, we use the 'row' variable of type 'DataRowView' and store the selected row in it. Now, use your Binding Paths, and reference individual columns of the selected row. Hope this helps! Cheers!

PS: Works if SelectionUnit = 'Row'
