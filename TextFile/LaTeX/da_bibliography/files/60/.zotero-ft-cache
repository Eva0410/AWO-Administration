Create a Word Document From a Template using c# (Mail Merge)

Posted by vivekcek on August 25, 2012

I want to create a word document from a word template.The advantage of using template is, we can define a structure for the document and decorate the it with dynamic text.

Software‚Äôs Used
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì

1. Word 2007.

2. Visual Studio 2010

Library used
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì

1. Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library

Steps
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

1. Create a Word Template.

2. Create a console application using VS 2010.

3. Add reference to Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library.

4. Enjoy üôÇ

1. Create a Word Template.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Word templates are created using MergeField‚Äôs in word.

a. Open a new Word 2007

b. Type ‚ÄúName:‚Äù, Where ‚ÄòName:‚Äô is just a label.

c. Now we need to insert a MergeField right to our label ‚ÄòName:‚Äô

d. Place cursor on the right of our label.

e. Select insert tab in word.

f. Select Quick Parts. Then Field.

g. Select field category as MergeField. Give the MergeField name as ‚ÄòName‚Äô.

h. Save the document as WordTemplate.

Now our Template contains.

Name: ¬´Name¬ª

The field inside <> is our merge Field. We will replace that field through code to create a new word document.

* Note the extension of out template will be .dotx(MyTemplate.dotx)

2. Create a console application using VS 2010.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
a. Create a console application.

b. Add refrence to Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library.

c. Add NameSpace ‚Äúusing Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word;‚Äù.

d. The Final document will be save in MyDocuments.

    If you use COM on server side (e.g. ASP.NET) you would probably have problems like this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257757 .

    You can try out this library http://flexdoc.codeplex.com/ which is free or some good but affordable third party like http://www.docentric.com .

    I want to do the same for bulk . i.e. letters should open in bulk for different values for the same mergefield in one document and data in there should come from the SQL server database.
