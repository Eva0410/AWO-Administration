MVVM SimpleIoc, how to use an interface when the interface implementation requires construction parameters

Using MVVM's SimpleIoc, I would like to register an implementation for a given interface, but the implementation requires one parameter in its constructor:

 public class MyServiceImplementation : IMyService { public MyServiceImplementation ( string contructorString ) { ... } }  

I was hoping that registering the implementation of the interface would work, but SimpleIoc doesn't consider the hint when it tries to resolve the interface.

 SimpleIoc . Default . Register < MyServiceImplementation >(() => { return new MyServiceImplementation ( "Hello World" ); }); SimpleIoc . Default . Register < IMyService , MyServiceImplementation >();  

Would there be a way to do this with SimpleIoc, or should I consider using a more complete Ioc?

Edit: This does the trick, but I still wonder why the form above doesn't work.

 SimpleIoc . Default . Register < IMyService >(() => { return new MyServiceImplementation ( "Hello World" ); });

The reason why your first approach is not working is that SimpleIOC does not use itself to construct the objects.

Given your declaration

 SimpleIoc . Default . Register < MyServiceImplementation >(() => { return new MyServiceImplementation ( "Hello World" ); }); SimpleIoc . Default . Register < IMyService , MyServiceImplementation >();  

The call to SimpleIoc.Default.GetInstance<MyServiceImplementation>() will execute the factory method, while the call to SimpleIoc.Default.GetInstance<IMyService>() won't.

A possible way to chain the calls could be to specify a factory method for both types, IMyService and MyServiceImplementation , i.e.

 SimpleIoc . Default . Register < MyServiceImplementation >(() => { return new MyServiceImplementation ( "Hello World" ); }); SimpleIoc . Default . Register < IMyService >(() => { return SimpleIoc . Default . GetInstance < MyServiceImplementation >(); });

Thanks @Obalix, that's certainly a nicer workaround than my own! –  Berthier Lemieux Jan 19 '12 at 6:13
