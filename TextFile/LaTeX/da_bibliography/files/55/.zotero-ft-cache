Can I receive SMS from my clients?

You can send and receive messages via our platform. To receive messages, you need an inbound receiving point which would be a dedicated Number.
Will I pay for incoming replies to my outgoing SMS messages?

At MessageBird, you don’t pay for receiving replies.
Can I send a text message from my company’s name?

Yes! Technically it’s possible to from your company’s name, but keep in mind that this is limited to between 3 and 11 characters and subject to any country restrictions.
What web browsers are supported by your web interface?

We support all web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc) - besides Internet Explorer 8 and 9, but anything from Internet Explorer 10 and over is. You can find out which version your browser is by going on this link .
What is your SLA?

You can find our SLA on our Service Level Agreement page .
Can a third party application be SMS enabled using MessageBird?

Yes! There are numerous CRM and communication platforms available that offer an optional integration of an SMS Gateway. The connection via API would usually be done with either the use of a username/API password combination or the use of an access key, both of which you can directly generate from within your MessageBird Dashboard in the ‘Developers’ section.
Why does MessageBird need my mobile phone number?

We ask for your mobile number in order to send you a verification code and to register your mobile in your account for free test credits! During your testing phase, you are given 9 free SMS to send messages to yourself, so to whitelist the number that you are going to send to, we verify it in your account when you sign up, this is only 'stored' for your trial period.
What is the activation code I received via SMS for and how do I use it?

This is the code that we use to verify your phone number to claim your free test credits. When you enter your phone number and hit ‘request code’, a popup will appear with a box for you to enter the code. Type in the code received and hit enter!
My activation code has not come through, what do I do?

Sometimes if the verification SMS doesn’t get through there might be an issue with the phone receiving SMS at that moment. Try switching the phone off completely, removing the battery and restarting it. Then request another message to test, and let us know if this number is still not receiving. If this still does not work then please let us know; send us the number in question to support@messagebird.com and we'll be happy to get your account ready for testing!
I’ve lost my username and/or password. How can I log in?

If you have an account, but don’t remember or have access to your username, there is an option when you go to login to our webpage to recover these.

Who pays for any incoming SMS messages (i.e. replies to the SMS messages I send out)?

If the end user is sending a reply to your Virtual Number, their provider will charge them their standard network rate to send an SMS. If you are receiving Premium SMS on a Keyword , then the end user is charged the premium rate that you have sent on your Keyword. You can find out more about that here. There is no cost to you to receive replies.

Who pays for failed messages?

We deduct the balance for all SMS sent from the account. We will send every SMS that you submit to us, whether it is sent to an active or an invalid number, on to the operator, who then in turn will try to deliver the SMS. We are charged by the operator, which is why we in turn charge you. If you have an API connection, you can check the validity of your number database using our HLR service .

    Allocate credit to the subaccounts, you can give a fixed amount to the subaccount(s) for their use. Once this has been used, the subaccount will see their balance has reached zero, and further credit must be added from the main account.
