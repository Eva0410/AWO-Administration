Command for DoubleClick on ListView's GridView Row
Ask Question
up vote 2 down vote favorite
1
	

Within my WPF - MVVM application, I have a ListView in which there's a GridView. On Double clicking a row in the GridView, I want to read the text in a column in that row.

I want to use commands to maintain the MVVM pattern.

I know that one can use InputBindings to wire up a command for DoubleClick event. but there's no InputBindings for GridView.

Any idea how to achieve the functionality??

Thanks

Note - Want to know whether the above can be achieved by purely using commands - without code-behind for DoubleClick event handling?

It would help if you included some of the XAML code you've written. –  Sridhar Jan 30 '15 at 9:54
   	 
	
Could it be that you want to achieve the same thing as here ? –  Claudio P Jan 30 '15 at 9:59
   	 
	
@Claudio - the Link you mentioned specifies using an event - but that would use Code-Behind. In MVVM that would not be very much accepted. I want to know whether is it possible to achieve the desired functionality using pure Commands? –  KhannaB7 Jan 30 '15 at 10:09
   	 
	
Whit the help of Interaction-Triggers you can simply bind an event to a command in your Viewmodel –  Claudio P Jan 30 '15 at 10:11

I used a CellTemplate for a column within my GridView, in that celltemplate I provided InputBindings - MouseBinding for Double Click event. This turns the double click event into a command & then i send the Cell's text as a command parameter.

 <ListView x:Name = "listview1" ItemsSource = "{Binding DataCollection}" > <ListView.View> <GridView ColumnHeaderContainerStyle = "{StaticResource ColumnHeaderStyle}" > <GridViewColumn Header = "ID" Width = "auto" DisplayMemberBinding = "{Binding ID}" /> <GridViewColumn Header = "PrimaryFile" Width = "auto" > <GridViewColumn.CellTemplate> <DataTemplate> <TextBlock Text = "{Binding PrimaryFile}" > <TextBlock.InputBindings> <MouseBinding Gesture = "LeftDoubleClick" Command = "{Binding Path=DataContext.ShowFileCommand, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type UserControl}}}" CommandParameter = "{Binding PrimaryFile}" /> </TextBlock.InputBindings> </TextBlock> </DataTemplate> </GridViewColumn.CellTemplate> </GridViewColumn> </GridView> </ListView.View> </ListView>  

Here, the usercontrol's datacontext was set to a viewmodel, and the ShowFileCommand was exposed on my viewmodel.

So on double clicking Cells in 2nd column, command was raised along with the text in the cell as command parameter

Thanks i got this to work. and is a good direction on what i required. however i cannot get this to work on multiple columns unless i replicate the same code for each column. –  New Bee Jul 27 '15 at 0:08

To get KhannaB7's suggestion to work on all columns within you grid view you will need to do this

Set a DataTemplate in your resources

 <UserControl.Resources> <ResourceDictionary> <DataTemplate x:Key = "GridViewCellTemplateStyle" > <TextBlock Text = "{Binding}" > <TextBlock.InputBindings> <MouseBinding Gesture = "LeftDoubleClick" Command = "{Binding DataContext.CommandDoubleClick, RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type ListView}}}" /> </TextBlock.InputBindings> </TextBlock> </DataTemplate> </ResourceDictionary> </UserControl.Resources>  

Create your grid view and make the columns inherit this datatemplate

 <ListView> <ListView.View> <GridView> <GridViewColumn Width = "Auto" Header = "Column1" CellTemplate = "{StaticResource GridViewCellTemplateStyle}" /> <GridViewColumn Width = "Auto" Header = "Column2" CellTemplate = "{StaticResource GridViewCellTemplateStyle}" /> <GridViewColumn Width = "Auto" Header = "Column3" CellTemplate = "{StaticResource GridViewCellTemplateStyle}" /> <GridViewColumn Width = "Auto" Header = "Column4" CellTemplate = "{StaticResource GridViewCellTemplateStyle}" /> </GridView> </ListView.View> </ListView>  

Of course you can put what ever you want in your template. mine just shows how to make a double click for a grid view column row

if its a datagrid you can do something like this

 <DataGrid> <DataGrid.Resources> <Style TargetType = "DataGridRow" > < EventSetter Event = "MouseDoubleClick" Handler = "Row_DoubleClick" /> </Style> </DataGrid.Resources> </DataGrid>
