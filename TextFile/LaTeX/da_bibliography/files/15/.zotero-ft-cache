Here's how my RESX file look like:

 Name Value Comments Rule_seconds seconds seconds Rule_Sound Sound Sound  

What I want is: Name by string Value, something like below:

 public string GetResxNameByValue ( string value ) { // some code to get name value }  

And implement it like below:

 string str = GetResxNameByValue ( "seconds" );  

so that str will return Rule_seconds

Thanks!

it seems this is only achievable if the resource file ensures no duplicate values,otherwise you might get unexpected resource keys returned. i.e. if you have two Names/keys (Time_Second, Sequence_Second), both have the value of 'second'. you might get the name of 'Time_second' when you expect the other one. –  cli Apr 13 at 4:40

This could work

 private string GetResxNameByValue ( string value ) { System . Resources . ResourceManager rm = new System . Resources . ResourceManager ( "YourNamespace.YourResxFileName" , this . GetType (). Assembly ); var entry = rm . GetResourceSet ( System . Threading . Thread . CurrentThread . CurrentCulture , true , true ) . OfType < DictionaryEntry >() . FirstOrDefault ( e => e . Value . ToString () == value ); var key = entry . Key . ToString (); return key ; }  

With some additional error checking..

Thanks, and what if the resource file is in assembly and not an actual (RESX) file in the project? –  Learner May 3 '13 at 15:05
   	 
	
You can specify assembly in which the resource is embeded in the ResourceManager constructor. But you still have to know resource base name. If you don't i think you could find out what resources are embeded into assembly by using Assembly.GetMainfestResourceNames –  jure May 3 '13 at 15:08
   	 
	
@jure: Is it possible to return all the key value pairs from the resource? –  Kuldeep Singh Jul 10 '15 at 8:01

you can access directly by passing key:

 public string gtresource ( string rulename ) { string value = null ; System . Resources . ResourceManager RM = new System . Resources . ResourceManager ( "CodedUITestProject1.Resource1" , this . GetType (). Assembly ); value = RM . GetString ( rulename ). ToString (); if ( value != null && value != "" ) { return value ; } else { return "" ; } }

On 7 lines of code, I see a couple of problems that need to be addressed: First RM.GetString(rulename) already returns a string. There's no need to call ToString() . Second, RM.GetString(rulename) can return null is the resource is not found, which will raise a NullReferenceException . Third, if(value !=null && value !="") will never be reached with a null value because of the NullReferenceException . Finally, you can replace all the if by return RM.GetString(rulename) ?? string.Empty; . –  PhilDulac Jun 9 '14 at 15:46

This does not address the original question which is the "reverse" of what you are posting as solution. By a specific value they key needs to be retrieved... –  Bernoulli IT Sep 21 '15 at 11:18

Just in case it might help anyone. This ResourceHelper is inspired by jure and Mohan Singh Saini .

 using System . Collections ; using System . Linq ; using System . Reflection ; using System . Resources ; using System . Threading ; public class ResourceHelper { /// <summary> /// ResourceHelper /// </summary> /// <param name="resourceName">i.e. "Namespace.ResourceFileName"</param> /// <param name="assembly">i.e. GetType().Assembly if working on the local assembly</param> public ResourceHelper ( string resourceName , Assembly assembly ) { ResourceManager = new ResourceManager ( resourceName , assembly ); } private ResourceManager ResourceManager { get ; set ; } public string GetResourceName ( string value ) { DictionaryEntry entry = ResourceManager . GetResourceSet ( Thread . CurrentThread . CurrentCulture , true , true ). OfType < DictionaryEntry >(). FirstOrDefault ( dictionaryEntry => dictionaryEntry . Value . ToString () == value ); return entry . Key . ToString (); } public string GetResourceValue ( string name ) { string value = ResourceManager . GetString ( name ); return ! string . IsNullOrEmpty ( value ) ? value : null ; } }

Any thoughts on how to reference strings resource in a referenced project? I keep getting an exception when attempting to reference it. –  BrianS Aug 19 '14 at 17:20
   	 
	
I found it. For loaded RESX files you can reference the built-in resource manager. See stackoverflow.com/a/22494089/264628 . –  BrianS Aug 19 '14 at 17:49
   	 
	
@BrianS Thanks for the supplement :) –  oloopy Aug 21 '14 at 14:50

 public static class ResourceManagerHelper { public static string GetResourceName ( this ResourceManager resourceManager , string value , CultureInfo cultureInfo , bool ignoreCase = false ) { var comparisonType = ignoreCase ? System . StringComparison . OrdinalIgnoreCase : System . StringComparison . Ordinal ; var entry = resourceManager . GetResourceSet ( cultureInfo , true , true ) . OfType < DictionaryEntry >() . FirstOrDefault ( dictionaryEntry => dictionaryEntry . Value . ToString (). Equals ( value , comparisonType )); if ( entry . Key == null ) throw new System . Exception ( "Key and value not found in the resource file" ); return entry . Key . ToString (); } }  

To Call this extension method,

 var key = Resources . ResourceManager . GetResourceName ( value , CultureInfo . InvariantCulture , true );  

In this case, we don't want to pass the resource assembly, rather we can invoke using the particular resource's resourceManager.

Can you explain a bit more how your answer works? –  Joey Ciechanowicz Apr 9 '15 at 9:04

ResourceManagerHelper is a common extension for ResourceManager. Every Resource file have Resource Manager, for example: Rule.resx is a resource file. Then to call Rule.ResourceManager.GetResourceName(val, mycultureinfo) –  Shyam Sundar Apr 9 '15 at 11:00
